# SOS-Squad
This project was built by the three of us in 24 hours at HackMIT 2018, and won the __Best in Show__ award sponsored by [Amadeus](https://amadeus.com/en)! Thank you to the Amadeus and IBM engineers who offered their time and knowledge to help us get our project up and running. 

You can deploy the app locally by running [app.py](app.py).

## Inspiration
In recent weeks, Hurricane Florence has wreaked havoc on communities in North Carolina and highlighted the need for a streamlined service to handle relief logistics. 

## What it does
SOS Squad is a two-way service: it enables disaster victims to search for supplies and help that they need, and allows good Samaritans to easily figure out where they are needed and how they can volunteer their time or resources. 

## How we built it
We used Python Flask with SQLite to build our web app and manage our databases. We integrated IBM's Weather API and Amadeus' API to provide weather alerts and flight / hotel lookup. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of / what we learned
None of us have any experience in creating web apps - we had to teach ourselves how to use Flask, SQLite, Bootstrap, and APIs within 24 hours. 

## What's next for SOS Squad
There are many other features we want SOS Squad to eventually incorporate - for example, people who are in affected areas can post projects that need to be completed, so that volunteers who are in the area know exactly what they can work on. We would also like to display the weather alerts and their locations on an interactive map for better readability.
